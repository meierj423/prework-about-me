      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a Naval Officer currently in the process of transitioning
         into the civilian sector. My longtime fascination with technology 
         and computers has sparked an interest in me beginning a career in 
         software development. I am enrolled in a coding bootcamp with UCSD 
         Extension in order to build a strong foundation in the skills required 
         to be a successful software developer.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Just before my fifth birthday, 
        my family and I moved to Chicago, Illinois where we lived for eight
         years before moving once again to Cincinnati, Ohio. We would remain in
          Cincinnati up until I left for the Naval Academy located in Annapolis,
           Maryland.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love going on adventures with my wife whether it is traveling or 
        finding a new place to eat in downtown San Diego. I also enjoy 
        running, watching sports, reading, cooking/baking, bowling, playing
         boardgames, and taking my puppy out for walks. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Software developer for Amazon.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Coronado, California</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has given me a fresh persective on the
         importance of technology. The fact that students all over the 
         world are able to continue in their education due to apps like 
         Zoom amazes me. It just goes to show that even during seemingly
          chaotic times, today's internet and technology are integral parts 
          of our society's perseverence. I want to be a web developer 
          in order to join the effort to strengthen and spread that 
          perseverance around the world. </p>
